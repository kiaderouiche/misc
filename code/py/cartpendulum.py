original problem:
I am trying to understand the force present in the system below. I found this picture online 
and I would like to ask what is the force N and P of the cart and Pendulum for? I tried to google it but i am not really sure what is the term of this force called and not much result is found for this 2 force.
May I seek some help on
understanding the force N and P , what is their purpose and why is it present?
