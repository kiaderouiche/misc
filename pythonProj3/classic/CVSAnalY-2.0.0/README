Description
-----------

The CVSAnalY tool extracts information out of source code repository logs and stores it into a database.

How to get CVSAnalY2
--------------------

	git clone http://git.libresoft.es/cvsanaly
        git clone git://git.libresoft.es/git/cvsanaly	

Requirements
------------

CVSAnalY has the following dependencies:

    * RepositoryHandler
	git clone http://git.libresoft.es/repositoryhandler
        git clone git://git.libresoft.es/git/repositoryhandler
    * cvs (optional, for CVS support)
    * subversion (optional, for SVN support)
    * git (optional, for Git support)
    * Python MySQLDB (optional but recommended)
    * Python SQLite (optional)

Install
-------

You can install cvsanaly2 running setup.py script:

    # python setup.py install

If you don't install CVSAnalY with root privileges, add to your $PATH
the directory which contains cvsanaly (cvsanalydir is the directory
where CVSAnalY is installed):

    $ export PATH=$PATH:cvsanalydir

CVSAnalY needs RepositoryHandler. If it is not installed in the usual
path for Python packages, PKG_CONFIG_PATH should include the directory
where it is installed (repohandlerdir is the path where RepositoryHandler
is installed):

    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:repohandlerdir

You are ready to use cvsanaly2!

Running cvsanaly2
-----------------

For the impatients: just checkout (from svn or cvs) to obtain a local
version of your repository, and then run cvsanaly2:

    $ cd project/
    ~/project$ cvsanaly2 

More options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be
learnt by running "cvsanaly2 --help"
